No, we have no plans to add support to MAC OS. 

If your project does not depends on gstramer pipleline please check this [link](https://github.com/google-coral/project-bodypix/issues/22#issuecomment-933920712) to get the posenet_decoder.dylib and make the code changes accordingly to make it work with MAC OS. 

 We would update this query if we are working on adding support to MAC OS.
